## Getting Started
1) Go to https://docs.google.com/forms/
Make a google form with the fields "magic" (short answer) and "payload" (paragraph)  
2) Go to Settings->responses and turn off requiring sign in  
3) Get a prefilled link, ensure magic is set to magic and payload is empty, change to
formResponse?submit=Submit  
4) Under responses, link to sheets   
5) Change spreadsheet sharing so that anyone with a link can be a viewer  
6) Take note of the spreadsheet ID, put in config file for backend
